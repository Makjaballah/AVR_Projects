# AVR_Projects

A microcontroller (or MCU for short) is a small, complete computer that fits on a single integrated circuit. a microcontroller contains a processor, memory, devices to receive input from various sources, and outputs that can be used to control or communicate with external devices. In this repository, I will give some examples showing how to take advantage of a chips from the inexpensive range of Microchip AVR 8-bit microcontrollers. 
The Atmel® ATmega328P is a low-power CMOS 8-bit microcontroller based on the AVR® enhanced RISC architecture. By executing powerful instructions in a single clock cycle, the ATmega328P achieves throughputs approaching 1MIPS per MHz allowing the system designer to optimize power consumption versus processing speed. I’ll walk you through 15 projects introducing a few cool real-world projects that use ATmega328p microcontroller from Microchip, and I’ll explain and demonstrate everything you need to knowfor each project.
The following sub-headings are given for each project where possible:
```
     1- Project Title
     2- Aim
     3- Hardware Requirements
     4- The main circuit diagram
```
