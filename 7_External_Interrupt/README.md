# Project: Handling an External Hardware Interrupt with Atmega328p Microcontroller

## The aim
The ATmega328p microcontroller supports two external interrupts which are individually enabled by setting bits INT1 and INT0 in the External Interrupt Mask Register. Upon activation of these interrupts, the ATmega328p microcontroller gets interrupted in whatever task it is doing and jumps to perform the interrupt service routine. The aim of this project is to show how to use an external Interrupt generated by a push-button with the ATmega328p microcontroller. The Embedded C is applied to compile program using Makefile within Vim editor.
To compile the embedded C code for the Atmega328p microcontroller, we need to open a terminal window, navigate to the project folder and enter the following command:
```
$ make
```
To upload the generated HEX file to the Atmega328p microcontroller, enter the following command:
```
$ avrdude -c USBasp -p m328p -B 4 -U flash:w:main.hex:i
```

## Hardware Requirements
